# Adding Vaadin to a previous project with GraphQL

This is an exaple made to demonstrate how to add Vaadin to a previous project with GraphQL.

In this case the previous project has been this one:
https://github.com/tcrurav/SpringGraphQL

## Getting Started

Clone this project:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/VaadinAddedToGraphQLProject.git
```

Open your Eclipse IDE and run this project as Spring boot App. If you don't know how, watch the following steps of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvzGf0cAlg4
* Install last JDK LTS.
* Install Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers.
* Configure your Eclipse IDE with your JDK.
* Install STS (Spring Tool Suite from Pivotal Company).
* Install MySQL Workbench.
* Import the db_bicycles_gql.sql file of this project in your MySQL Server.
* Configure your connection to MySQL editing user/password in the file application.properties of this project.

Once you have followed all the steps above, run the project as Spring Boot App.

If everything went well you can now check that both GraphQL and Vaadin work:

## How to proceed to add Vaadin to a previous project

You can always add Vaadin or any other dependency to your project after having created it by right clicking on your pom.xml -> Spring --> Add Starters:

After that just follow the usual procedure to add any new dependency. In this case: Vaadin

And then you can happily start coding. It's always interesting to organize your code with packages. In this case I have added the package com.tiburcio.bicyclesWithGraphQL.vaadin.

Follow this video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvzGf0cAlg4

## Built With

* [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/) - Install it if you want to edit this project backend with Eclipse IDE.
* [Spring Tools Suite](https://spring.io/tools) - Install the plugin in Eclipse IDE.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

* [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
* [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) - A tool that helps you structure GraphQL queries correctly.
